{"name":"Z-Push-OX","tagline":"An Open-Xchange Z-Push-2 Backend","body":"Z-Push-OX\r\n=========\r\n\r\nZ-Push-OX is a [Z-Push]-2 backend for Open-Xchange. As it is a work in progress\r\nplease see the [feature matrix] for the currently implemented features and take a\r\nlook at the [bugtracker].\r\n\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n![Z-Push-2 infrastructure](http://z-push.sourceforge.net/soswp/uploads/1232370881.png)\r\n\r\n[Z-Push]-2 is an implementation of Microsoft's ActiveSync protocol which is used\r\n'over-the-air' for multi platform active sync devices, including Windows Mobile, \r\nApple's iPhone, Sony Ericsson and Nokia phones.\r\n\r\nZ-Push-OX is implemented as backend using the Differential Engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe changelog can be found [here][changelog].\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n  * Open-Xchange >= 7.2.1\r\n  * Z-Push-2 >= 2.1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n----\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/z-push-ox/Z-Push-Demo.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/z-push-ox/Z-Push-Demo)\r\n\r\nFor this to work you need an [ox.io] account. Keep in mind, that the \r\ndemo does not perform as well as on a dedicated server.\r\n\r\nYou should NOT transfer/input ANY sensitive data using this demo as \r\nyou should not do this with your [ox.io] account either. Currently the\r\nconnection between the demo server and [ox.io] is not encrypted.\r\n\r\n### Login Data\r\n\r\n| Input    | Value                                          |\r\n| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Username | username with domain (i.e.: test@ox.io)        |\r\n| EMail    | the email adress you picked (i.e.: test@ox.io) |\r\n| Server   | zpox-liob.rhcloud.com                          |\r\n\r\nThe domain of the EMail address differs from the domain of the test server. This\r\nwill not be expected from your ActiveSync client. Therefore you need to input the \r\ndemo server domain name in the advanced settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nRPM and DEB files are provided on the [releases] page of the repository.\r\n\r\nAfter resolving the dependencies and installing Z-Push-OX you need to \r\n[configure Z-Push-2][setup z-push]. Than change the Z-Push-2 config.php to use the \r\nZ-Push-OX Backend:\r\n\r\n        define('BACKEND_PROVIDER', \"BackendOX\");\r\n        define('OX_SERVER', 'https://your.server'); //http is also valid\r\n\r\nYou can find a working example config.php [here](https://gist.github.com/liob/6183593).\r\n\r\n### Debian / Ubuntu\r\n\r\nZ-Push has been re-branded by Debian and is called d-push. You may find the\r\nappropriate deb files [here][d-push].\r\n\r\nDependencies for [HTTP\\_Request2] and [Net\\_URL2] are not included for the deb files as \r\nthere are no official deb files for them. You need to resolve these dependencies for \r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n      pear install --alldeps HTTP_Request2 Net_URL2\r\n\r\n### Nightly Builds\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/z-push-ox/z-push-ox.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/z-push-ox/z-push-ox)\r\n\r\nThere are [nightly builds] available. Keep in mind however, that these are likely to be\r\nmore unstable than release builds.\r\n\r\n### From Source\r\n\r\n1.  [setup z-push]\r\n\r\n2.  make sure the following extra php libs are installed:\r\n\r\n   * [HTTP\\_Request2]\r\n\r\n   * [Net\\_URL2]\r\n\r\n3.  clone z-push-ox in the backends directory as ox\r\n\r\n        cd backend && git clone https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox.git ox\r\n\r\n4.  add the following to the backend settings (config.php):\r\n\r\n        define('BACKEND_PROVIDER', \"BackendOX\");\r\n        define('OX_SERVER', 'https://your.server'); //http is also valid\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Requests & Bugs\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nPlease use the projects [bugtracker] to report bugs or file feature requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n[bugtracker]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/issues\r\n[d-push]: http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=d-push\r\n[feature matrix]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/blob/master/featurematrix.md\r\n[changelog]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/blob/master/changelog\r\n[HTTP\\_Request2]: http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2\r\n[Net\\_URL2]: http://pear.php.net/package/Net_URL2\r\n[nightly builds]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/z-push-ox/files/\r\n[ox.io]: https://www.ox.io\r\n[releases]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/releases\r\n[setup z-push]: http://doc.zarafa.com/7.0/Administrator_Manual/en-US/html/_zpush.html\r\n[Z-Push]: http://z-push.sourceforge.net\r\n","google":"UA-42989654-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
