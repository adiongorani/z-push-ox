{"name":"Z-PUSH-OX","tagline":"An Open-Xchange Z-Push-2 Backend","body":"Z-Push-OX\r\n=========\r\n\r\nZ-Push-OX is a Z-Push-2 backend for Open-Xchange. As it is a work in progress\r\nplease see the [feature matrix] for the currently implemented features and take a\r\nlook at the [bugtracker].\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n![](http://z-push.sourceforge.net/soswp/uploads/1232370881.png)\r\n\r\nZ-Push-2 is an implementation of Microsoft's ActiveSync protocol which is used\r\n'over-the-air' for multi platform active sync devices, including Windows Mobile\r\nand active sync used on Apple's iPhone, Sony Ericsson and Nokia phones. Open\r\nsource Z-Push enables any PHP-based groupware package to become fully syncable\r\nwith any ActiveSync-compliant device.\r\n\r\nZ-Push-OX is implemented as backend using the Differential Engine.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe changelog can be found [here][changelog].\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n  * Open-Xchange >= 7.2.1\r\n  * Z-Push-2 >= 2.0.7\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nRPM and DEB files are provided on the [releases] page of the repository.\r\n\r\n### Debian / Ubuntu\r\n\r\nZ-Push has been re-branded by Debian and is called d-push. You may find the\r\nappropriate deb files [here][d-push].\r\n\r\nWe did not include [HTTP\\_Request2] and [Net\\_URL2] as dependency for the deb files as \r\nthere are no official deb files for them. You need to resolve this dependency for \r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n      pear install --alldeps HTTP_Request2 Net_URL2\r\n\r\n### Nightly Builds\r\n\r\nThere are [nightly builds] available. Keep in mind however, that these are likely to be\r\nmore unstable than release builds.\r\n\r\n### From Source\r\n\r\n1.  [setup z-push]\r\n\r\n2.  make sure the following extra php libs are installed:\r\n\r\n   * [HTTP\\_Request2]\r\n\r\n   * [Net\\_URL2]\r\n\r\n3.  clone z-push-ox in the backends directory as ox\r\n\r\n        cd backend && git clone https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox.git ox\r\n\r\n4.  add the following to the backend settings (config.php):\r\n\r\n        define('BACKEND_PROVIDER', \"BackendOX\");\r\n        define('OX_SERVER', 'https://your.server'); //http is also valid\r\n\r\nFeature Requests & Bugs\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nPlease use the projects [bugtracker] to report bugs or file feature requests.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.\r\n\r\n[bugtracker]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/issues\r\n[d-push]: http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=d-push\r\n[feature matrix]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/blob/master/featurematrix.md\r\n[changelog]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/blob/master/changelog\r\n[HTTP\\_Request2]: http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2\r\n[Net\\_URL2]: http://pear.php.net/package/Net_URL2\r\n[nightly builds]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/z-push-ox/files/\r\n[releases]: https://github.com/z-push-ox/z-push-ox/releases\r\n[setup z-push]: http://doc.zarafa.com/7.0/Administrator_Manual/en-US/html/_zpush.html\r\n[Z-Push]: http://z-push.sourceforge.net\r\n","google":"UA-42989654-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
